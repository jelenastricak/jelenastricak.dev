# Fifty AIs, Three Cooking Sprees, and One Near-Collapse

**Or: How I Tried to Automate My Life and Accidentally Became a Walking
Temp File**

I didn't plan on creating my own personal Doomsday Machine. I only
wanted to test a few AI tools, make some content, and maybe finish one
of the five apps rotting in my shell. Instead I opened my laptop like a
normal person and an hour later found myself orchestrating digital
Armageddon: fifty Canva templates screaming for attention, five shell
projects choking for oxygen, two more stranded in Replit, three preening
mockups in Lovable, and three AIs arguing over whether my marketing copy
should be "sinister" or "ethically compliant."

My computer wheezed. My brain wheezed. Even my dog, Grunf, gave me the
look: *you're on your own with this one.*

This is not a productivity hack. This is a crash report.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Too many tools, not enough sanity

On paper, more tools should equal more power. In reality, they equal
total paralysis. Every shiny new platform promises salvation: Canva will
fix my content pipeline, Figma will make my apps beautiful, Lovable will
practically build them for me, and Replit will host my genius on the
cloud. Add ten different AI models with quirky personalities and you
should have an empire.

Instead, you have collapse.

When everything looks like a solution, you stop solving and start
sampling. You dabble. You prompt. You pivot. You half-finish. At the end
of the day you don't have a portfolio of polished projects --- you have
an elegantly curated landfill of half-baked experiments.

Human consequences? Predictable and glamorous:\
- Obsessive cleaning, because decluttering the apartment tricks me into
thinking I decluttered my mind.\
- Cooking like tomorrow every supermarket burns down --- stress tastes
very good fried. (Seven kilos in a week. Don't clap.)\
- Computer seizures perfectly synced with my brain fog.\
- Three "spin doctor" AIs arguing ethics vs. edge while my tour group
waits in the rain to learn about 17th-century city walls.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The tools, rated with sarcasm

**Nano Banana**\
Beautiful images at first. By generation three or four it hallucinates
like a conspiracy theorist who hasn't slept since 2008. Great for
one-offs, useless for iteration.

**SuperGrok**\
Feels like an AI on LSD. Visually stunning, narratively chaotic. Ask for
a tour poster and you'll get Solana tokens wrestling ancient Greek gods
in front of a blockchain colosseum. Pretty, nonsensical, and slightly
arsonist.

**Perplexity**\
Image generation: laughable. Video generation: tragic. Use it for a
giggle; don't expect content you can actually use.

**ChatGPT**\
The reliable soldier. It follows instructions and behaves like a
competent assistant --- until the page decides it's tired and collapses
mid-sentence like a sulking teenager.

**Gemini Pro**\
So simple it stings. Good for quick answers, bad for nuance. Like asking
a toddler to explain astrophysics.

**Gemini CLI**\
Terminal bloat. Takes up space and produces little. My shell deserves
better.

**Claude Code (Terminal)**\
My MVP. Reads, writes, scaffolds, explains. Behaves like a collaborator.
The tragedy? Tokens. You hit the wall too early and your genius agent
gets amnesia. Then you both cry, quietly, into the prompt.

**Figma**\
Stunning mockups. Not an IDE. It seduces designers and then expects
developers to do magic.

**Lovable**\
Prettier than Figma, somehow less useful. It's the makeup tutorial of
app builders: you'll look gorgeous in screenshots, but you're still not
shipping anything.

**Replit**\
Ugly, competent, and ruthlessly practical. It doesn't care about looks;
it cares that your project runs. Respectable shovel, hideous handle.

**Canva (50 templates)**\
The carbs of design. Quick, comforting, dopamine-rich --- but not
nutritious for product UX. Great for social posts, not for building
products.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The painful truth: AI ≠ magic

Every AI I use has an upside and a catastrophic downside. None are
perfect. The line between something useful and something laughable isn't
the model --- it's the prompt and the human at the helm.

AI multiplies what you bring to the table. If you're focused, it
sharpens. If you're scattered, it makes your collapse spectacular.

Too many prompts scatter your focus. Too many apps guarantee collapse.
These weeks of chaos taught me: AI doesn't save you from yourself. It
accelerates you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Coping strategies (spoiler: they're boring)

To stop imploding, I've been forcing myself into five brutal rules.
Boring, but effective.

**1. Lock 90-minute focus blocks.** One project, one tool, no cheating.\
*Update: Didn't accomplish that. Still trying my best. BUT --- ADHD. So
instead of one project, I juggle seven or eight parallel ones. Oh, what
a joy.*

**2. Ship one thing every 48 hours.** Even if that thing is a README.
Progress beats perfection --- kind of managing that one.

**3. Cull the tool zoo.** One tool per category: design, prototyping, AI
dev. Everything else goes into exile. This decision did not go well. My
head hurts.

**4. Token budget.** I give Claude and ChatGPT strict caps. When they
run out, so do I. No crying over lost context. (Tried Gemini CLI again;
it made me laugh and cry a little.)

**5. Self-care alarms.** Declutter 15 minutes. Get off the screen 30
minutes. Cook --- yes --- but maybe don't make enough risotto to feed a
Roman legion.

These aren't sexy hacks. They're boring, and they actually stop the
spirals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The cooking factor

Let's be clear: I don't order food. Ever. I cook. Exceptionally. My
problem is panic cuisine: when I'm overwhelmed I turn into a culinary
prepper, convinced all groceries will vanish by morning.

AI meltdown looks like this:\
- Brain: "too many tasks."\
- Body: "fry onions until further notice."\
- Outcome: seven kilos that prove stress is edible.

If you measure productivity in curries and pasta, I'm crushing it. If
you measure it in shipped apps, Claude and I need a family meeting.

Also, if my Echo tells me one more time to drink a glass of water, I
might just throw it out the window.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion: collapse with style

Every AI in my arsenal has one foot in brilliance and one foot in
absurdity. Nano Banana gives beauty until it hallucinates. SuperGrok
makes gorgeous nonsense. Perplexity fumbles video. ChatGPT helps, then
freezes. Gemini Pro disappoints. Gemini CLI is laughable. Claude Code is
genius until it forgets me. Figma and Lovable seduce; Replit grunts and
ships; Canva feeds dopamine and starves deliverables.

The only real constant is me. My chaos, my clutter, my prompts, my
compulsive cleaning, and my late-night meals that could fuel a medieval
army.

The AI industry doesn't like admitting this. The truth is simple: AI is
not magic. It's multiplication. It multiplies whatever you bring. Be
clear, and it sharpens. Be chaotic, and it combusts.

So here I am: combusting with style --- teaching history by day,
vibe-coding apps by night, trading Solana at dawn, guiding tours when
required, and cooking through the collapse. If anyone invents an AI that
slaps my cursor away after five open tabs, I'll crown it emperor. Until
then, I'll keep sautéing my sanity in garlic butter and pretending
that's a plan.
