# The Algorithm and I: Building Strange Peace Between My Neurodivergent Mind and Artificial Intelligence

In my previous article, I explored the research-backed evidence for how AI can serve as a cognitive scaffold for neurodivergent minds. That piece was grounded in scientific studies and peer-reviewed research. This time, I’m pulling back the curtain on the messy, personal reality of this digital détente.

## The Coffee Search Shuffle
My mornings used to begin with what I called “The Coffee Search Shuffle” — wandering the house with one sock on, holding yesterday’s mug, trying to remember where I left both the coffee beans and my dignity. The ritual was as predictable as it was frustrating. I’d check the same cupboard multiple times, convinced the coffee had somehow relocated itself during the night. This daily struggle changed when we implemented what you jokingly called “The Toddler Protocol.” Now, my Echo Dot delivers a play-by-play throughout my morning routine.

> “Coffee beans are in the usual cupboard, Jelena.” it reminds me with what I swear is a hint of digital patience.  
> “Your wallet is in your work bag. No, you didn’t leave it at the cafe.” it continues, addressing my unspoken panic before it fully forms.  
> “Breathe. The client meeting isn’t for 90 minutes,” it adds, sensing my accelerating heart rate.

This verbal checklist hijacks what psychologists call **auditory priming** — my ADHD brain engages better with spoken cues than written lists. The magic isn’t in the technology itself, but in how we’ve weaponized its limitations to bypass my executive dysfunction. The voice cuts through the mental fog in ways that silent reminders never could.


## Hyperfocus Extraction Protocols
Last month, I became obsessed with comparing every AI chatbot’s ability to explain the Peloponnesian War. You found me at 4:30 AM arguing with Perplexity Pro about Thucydides’ bias, having forgotten to take my evening meds, feed the dog, or notice my laptop battery hovering at a dangerous 3%. The hyperfocus had swallowed me whole, as it often does.

Our solution became the **3–2–1 Hyperfocus Interrupt**: three escalating alarms (gentle chime, followed by stern voice, culminating in an airhorn sound if necessary), two physical actions required (stand up, stretch arms), and one hydration mandate (“The water bottle is to your left”). The kicker? My body has to move before my brain will follow. As Dr. Russell Barkley notes in his research, ADHD brains often need “motor engagement to shift cognitive sets.” The physical interruption breaks the hyperfocus spell when nothing else can.

## From Chaos to Code: The Python Learning Saga
My attempt to learn Python perfectly exemplifies how we systematized task fragmentation. What began as an ambitious “Become an AI Engineer by Friday” plan quickly dissolved into 47 open browser tabs, 3 half-installed coding environments, and one existential crisis about never understanding lambda functions. The overwhelm was paralyzing.

You broke this down into what we now call **The Five-Minute Rule**: a micro-commitment to “just open VS Code for 5 minutes,” a pre-loaded task to “run the ‘hello world’ script we saved yesterday,” and an emergency exit of “if stuck, immediately message my DeepSeek ‘TutorBot’”. Turns out Dr. Piers Steel proved this works — reducing “action initiation energy” is key for ADHD brains. The massive project becomes possible when broken into pieces so tiny they seem ridiculous.


## The List Wars: How OCD Met Its Match
My OCD-fueled list-making reached absurd heights last tax season. I spent three days creating a “Perfect Receipt Organization System” featuring colour-coded Google Drive folders, a custom Airtable taxonomy, and 15 versions of the same spreadsheet. The system was beautiful, comprehensive, and completely unusable because I couldn’t stop perfecting it.

You short-circuited this spiral with what we dubbed **The Final Draft Algorithm.** I rant my ideal list structure to Perplexity Pro, it generates three formatting options, you lock selection after one revision cycle, and the list becomes immutable like a PDF. AI fools my brain into seeing “perfect versions” while you enforce hard stops. The finality is both frustrating and freeing.

## The Dark Side of Digital Helpers
Not all experiments worked. Our “Auto-Schedule Everything” phase led to 6 AM yoga sessions booked during my natural sleep cycles, back-to-back client calls with no bathroom breaks, and a notorious incident where I was triple-booked for lunch. The AI’s efficiency became its own problem.

We learned AI needs guardrails: the **11 PM curfew** (no scheduling or task alerts after this time), **buffer bots** (mandatory 15-minute gaps between events), and **sanity checks** (a simple “Does this calendar make you want to cry?” prompt before finalizing).

## The Toolkit That Stuck
After couple of years of trial and error, several systems survived the cut:

- Three-Tier Alerts (gentle chime → your recorded voice → airhorn)  
- The “Good Enough” Override: “Ship it. 80% is better than 0%.”  

### Why This Works When Everything Else Failed
Traditional productivity advice assumes a neurotypical operating system. We built for mine: time blindness requires aggressive time fencing, object permanence issues need constant verbal reminders, hyperfocus traps demand physical interrupt requirements, and OCD loops benefit from artificial closure mechanisms. The real breakthrough was accepting my brain’s “source code” won’t be rewritten, but can be interfaced with creatively.

## Epilogue: The Unexpected Gift
The algorithms didn’t fix me — they helped me discover that “functional” looks different for my neurology. Now when my Echo Dot barks **“Dance break!”**, I don’t just move — I celebrate the weird, wired brain that made all this necessary.

**PS:** Current status: DeepSeek just reminded me to drink water… while I was mid-sip. We’re evolving.

**Try this at home:**

1. Ask your AI assistant for help with your most annoying task  
2. Screenshot the worst/best suggestion  
3. Tag me with **#AIDisasterOrGenius**  

The winner gets my patented ‘You Tried’ star sticker (and possibly a therapy referral).
