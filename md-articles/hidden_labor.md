# The Hidden Labor of AI: Why Prompting Feels Like Teaching — and Why It Deserves More Credit

*Jul 16, 2025*


**AI or student? Same difference**
After years trying to get teenagers interested in the Habsburg dynasty, I’ve come to a strange realization: crafting the perfect AI prompt is a lot like lesson planning. In both cases, you’re wrestling chaos into something workable. It takes patience, strategy, and a deep understanding of who — or what — you’re talking to. Honestly, one even pays better these days.

This isn’t just some clever turn of phrase — it’s my real life now. Just the other day, I spent almost half an hour going back and forth with an AI, trying to get it to explain the Treaty of Westphalia in terms a 15-year-old would actually care about. I adjusted my questions, gave stricter instructions, tried again and again, hoping for a response that wasn’t dry or robotic.

Here’s the thing: writing prompts for AI isn’t a fancy new superpower. It’s simply teaching, with a digital twist. Whether you’re wrangling a stubborn teenager or a stubborn chatbot, you have to figure out how that mind works and what makes information click. Both jobs demand real skill — and both are typically treated as if they’re easy or “soft.” That’s not fair to teachers, and it’s certainly not fair to the folks guiding AI either.

The tools I developed in the classroom, I now use every time I sit down to manage my digital “helpers.”

The student hasn’t changed; only their form has.


**Scaffolding for the Literal-Minded**
Ask any teacher: you can’t toss a 500-page book at a distracted kid and hope for the best. You break it down. Bullet points, timelines, a glossary for antiquated words — whatever it takes so they don’t drown in details.

AI operates the same way. Left to its own devices, a chatbot will spit out all kinds of trivia, some true, some just close enough to fool you. If my teenage students shut down at a big assignment, I’ll tell them, “Just give it five minutes.” With AI, I’ll say, “Give me three bullet points on the causes of the Peloponnesian War, in plain English, no more than 100 words.” The prompt is the scaffold. It provides just enough structure to keep things focused and clear.


**Asking, Tweaking, Asking Again**
Good teaching is often just good questioning. You nudge students toward their own reasons and insights. You don’t just hand them the answer; you chip away, ask differently, see what resonates.

That’s precisely how I work with AI now. Sometimes it feels like a modern Socratic dialogue — except this time, Socrates has an internet connection… and a habit of missing the point. I’ll start simple: “Explain feudalism.” I get back a dictionary entry. Then: “Pretend you’re talking to someone on TikTok who thinks feudalism is just ‘cottagecore.’” It gets more playful, but still a little off. I keep asking, tweaking, pushing — until finally I see something that might actually connect. It’s teaching by way of trial and error, only the student is made of code.


**The Gifted but Literal Student**
Everyone remembers that clever kid in class who could memorize dates but struggled with “why does it matter?” AI is that kid, amplified a thousand times over.

As a tour guide, I can rattle off the date Archduke Franz Ferdinand was killed. The meaningful part is that he’d narrowly survived a bombing just hours before — a reminder history is full of messy details and strange luck. An AI might know the facts; it consistently misses the punchline and the irony.

So, I take what the AI provides — the cold list, the external view — and reinsert the story. I pull the threads together, turning “what” into “so what.” Machines compute. Humans connect.



**The Real Cost: Unseen Labor**
Seeing prompt-writing as a form of teaching isn’t just semantics. There’s real work happening here, often for free, all the time.

Most teachers, according to Pew, are now using AI in their classrooms. But none are getting paid more for this extra expertise. It’s simply expected. “Adapt quickly, do more with less, and oh — love what you do.” Classic.

And it’s not just schools. As a freelancer, clients see “AI-assisted” on an invoice and think: easy. They picture a magic button, not the half-dozen failed drafts and the trial-and-error behind every polished answer. Getting the right output is fast. Getting there isn’t.

Think about medieval scribes: their labor was slow, visible, and respected. Now, the work is hidden, powering vast industries — but we’re just “users,” our skills taken for granted.



**Beware the Perfection Trap**
Of course, there are pitfalls. The same focus that helps a good teacher or a stubborn prompt-writer can tip into obsession. I’ve spent hours tuning a single question, lost track of time, and forgotten what I originally set out to do.

It can also feed perfectionism — endless tweaking, never quite satisfied. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking, and the real job isn’t getting done.

Worst of all, if we act like only the AI matters, we lose sight of what humans contribute. AI can churn out answers, but people hold the wisdom, the “what next,” the empathy. No program can look you in the eye and ask, “How did that make you feel?”


**Let's Give Credit Where It's Due**
Let’s stop pretending prompt-writing is “cheating” or “easy.” It’s its own craft — a mix of librarian, translator, and teacher rolled into one. That work deserves serious respect, and yes, fair compensation.

So next time someone says, “Just ask a chatbot,” you’ll know: even the fanciest AI still needs a human teacher. And teachers deserve more than thanks — they deserve genuine support.
